# Learn-to-Earn Streaming Platform

## Topic-Stacking Protocol for Educational DAOs
This platform utilizes a *topic-stacking protocol* that allows educators to align content with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Topics are created and managed on-chain, ensuring transparency and collaboration. Each topic serves as a knowledge node in the DAO's curriculum.

### Workflow:
1. *Create Topics*: Admins define topics that align with DAO learning objectives.
2. *Stream Allocation*: Educators create streams and allocate reward pools for viewers.
3. *Learn-to-Earn*: Learners watch streams, complete topics, and earn rewards.
4. *Consensus*: Community members vote to add or remove topics based on relevance.
